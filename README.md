# Logonyte Backend

Welcome to the Logonyte backend repository! This backend code serves as the server-side component for the Logonyte web application, providing functionalities such as user authentication, database operations, and API endpoints for frontend communication.

## Installation

To set up the Logonyte backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Configuration

Before running the backend, make sure to configure the necessary environment variables. You may need to set up environment files (e.g., `.env`) to store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and JWT secrets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server in production mode. Make sure to set up appropriate configurations for production, such as database connections and security settings.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the server in development mode. This mode enables features like hot reloading, allowing you to make changes to the codebase and see the updates reflected immediately without restarting the server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner to execute backend tests. Ensure that all endpoints, database queries, and middleware functions are thoroughly tested to maintain code quality and reliability.

## Database

The backend relies on a database to store application data. Make sure to set up and configure your preferred database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) and adjust the database connection settings in the configuration files accordingly.

## API Documentation

The API endpoints provided by the backend are documented to facilitate frontend development and integration. Ensure that the API documentation is kept up-to-date with any changes made to the endpoints or request/response formats.

## Deployment

When deploying the backend to a production environment, consider factors such as scalability, security, and performance. Deploy the server using reliable hosting services (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) and implement security measures like HTTPS, rate limiting, and authentication to protect sensitive data and ensure smooth operation.
